## What else is there

- Apatite - A program used to simplify file management
- Kanta - A program used to simplify reading and writing to files (merged)


## But why?
Primarily, these programs were designed to make my life easier. Instead of rewriting code for every project, I just reuse the same basic code by updating the individual modules. Also allows for simplicity and modularity, too.
